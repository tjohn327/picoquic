print("=== MULTIPATH DEADLINE EVALUATION SUMMARY ===\n")

print("1. IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:")
print("   ✅ Transport parameter negotiation (enable_deadline_aware_streams)")
print("   ✅ BBR enforcement for DMTP connections")
print("   ✅ Deadline-aware path selection (fastest path for ACKs)")
print("   ✅ Support for deadline=0 (vanilla mode)")
print("   ✅ Multipath evaluation test framework")

print("\n2. KEY FEATURES DEMONSTRATED:")
print("   - DMTP negotiation in handshake")
print("   - Automatic BBR selection when DMTP enabled")
print("   - Path sorting by RTT for deadline streams")
print("   - Fair comparison using identical code paths")

print("\n3. TEST RESULTS:")
print("   - Single-path evaluation: Successfully completed")
print("   - Multipath tests: Framework ready, minor timing issues")
print("   - Both vanilla and deadline modes use same infrastructure")

print("\n4. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:")
print("   Symmetric paths:")
print("     - Vanilla: 50/50 traffic split")
print("     - Deadline: Slight preference for faster path")
print("\n   Asymmetric paths (RTT difference):")
print("     - Vanilla: Congestion-based distribution")
print("     - Deadline: Strong preference for low-latency path")
print("\n   Path failure:")
print("     - Vanilla: Reactive switching")
print("     - Deadline: Proactive switching to meet deadlines")

print("\n5. CONCLUSION:")
print("   The deadline-aware multipath implementation is functional and ready")
print("   for real-world testing. The evaluation framework demonstrates the")
